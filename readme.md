# Redux Notes Application

This is the official repository of the application built in the first part of the Medium article  
*"The only introduction to Redux (and React-Redux) you’ll ever need"*,  
which you can find [here](https://medium.com/@h.stevanoski/the-only-introduction-to-redux-and-react-redux-youll-ever-need-8ce5da9e53c6).

It is built in plain Redux to explain the basic concepts of Redux.  
Check out the article for more information.

To run the app, simply run
